# Feature Specification: Programmatic JWT Generation

**Feature Branch**: `[002-programmatic-jwt-generation]`  
**Created**: 2025-09-16  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "programmatic jwt generation"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using this library, I want the client to generate a Snowflake keypair JWT programmatically (without shelling out to snowsql) so that services can obtain tokens automatically in containerized/CI environments.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given a configured private key and account/user identifiers, When requesting a control-plane JWT, Then the library returns a signed JWT accepted by Snowflake control-plane endpoints.
2. Given missing or invalid key material, When attempting JWT generation, Then the library returns a clear, actionable error without panicking.

### Edge Cases
- Key formats: PKCS#8 (PEM/DER) vs encrypted PEM passphrase handling [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: will we support encrypted keys in v1?]
- Clock skew: token "nbf/exp" validation tolerances [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: allowable skew window?]
- Multi-tenant: user vs role identifiers and audience/origin URLs [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- FR-001: The system MUST generate a keypair JWT compatible with Snowflake control-plane authentication given account, user, and private key inputs.
- FR-002: The system MUST expose configuration via file and environment variables for JWT parameters (issuer/subject, audience, expiration).
- FR-003: The system MUST validate time-based claims and allow configurable expiration duration.
- FR-004: The system MUST produce actionable errors for invalid keys, malformed claims, or signature failures.
- FR-005: The system MUST be testable without network by validating JWT structure/signature locally.

*Ambiguities to resolve*
- FR-006: The system MUST support encrypted PEM keys [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: passphrase source and format].
- FR-007: The system MUST support multiple signing algorithms [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: RS256 only, or also ES256?].

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)
- JWT Claims: issuer, subject, audience, issued-at, expiration, nonce/unique ID
- Key Material: private key (PEM/DER), optional passphrase
