# Feature Specification: Simple JWT Refresh Logic

**Feature Branch**: `[007-simple-jwt-refresh]`  
**Created**: 2025-09-18  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "simple jwt refresh logic"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A long-running ingestion process keeps pushing data to Snowflake without interruption while the library silently refreshes JWTs in the background.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a client process is authenticated and actively issuing requests, **When** the current JWT has less than the configured safety margin remaining, **Then** the library refreshes it before the next Snowflake API call so the request succeeds without prompting the integrator.  
2. **Given** the Snowflake API returns a 401 response, **When** the library retries once with a freshly generated JWT, **Then** the retry succeeds; if the retry also fails with 401, the library surfaces an authentication error after logging a warning.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Snowflake responds with `429 TOO MANY REQUESTS`? The library must wait for two seconds after logging a warning, then retry with the existing (or freshly refreshed) JWT.  
- How does the system behave when integrators provide their own JWT instead of a private key? The library should treat that capability as deprecated, emit a warning, and prefer internally managed JWT generation.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST maintain uninterrupted access for authenticated clients by refreshing JWTs automatically based on the configured safety margin.  
- **FR-002**: System MUST detect when a JWT will expire within 30 seconds (or configured margin) and generate a replacement before issuing the next API request.  
- **FR-003**: System MUST automatically retry exactly once after a 401 response using a freshly generated JWT, logging a warning before the retry and surfacing an authentication error if the retry fails.  
- **FR-004**: System MUST treat `429 TOO MANY REQUESTS` as a recoverable condition by logging a warning, sleeping for two seconds, and then retrying the request.  
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate JWT configuration values, auto-clamp `jwt_exp_secs` into the `[30, 3600]` range, and warn when clamping occurs.  
- **FR-006**: System MUST mark user-provided JWT configuration as deprecated, preferring in-memory key-based generation, and log guidance to migrate.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Session Token**: Represents the currently active JWT with issued-at and expiration timestamps; regenerated as needed from the stored private key.  
- **Private Key Material**: In-memory credentials supplied by the integrator; used to sign new JWTs and expected to remain valid indefinitely.
