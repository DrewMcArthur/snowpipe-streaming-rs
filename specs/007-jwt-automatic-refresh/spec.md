# Feature Specification: JWT Automatic Refresh

**Feature Branch**: `007-jwt-automatic-refresh`  
**Created**: 2025-09-17  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "jwt automatic refresh, based on token expiration, before sending requests to the server, ensure the token isn't almost expired, and if it is, generate a new one"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a platform operations lead, I need the service to auto-refresh authentication tokens before they lapse so that data delivery to downstream systems is uninterrupted.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a valid token that will expire within the defined refresh window, **When** a user-initiated or scheduled request is about to be sent, **Then** the system generates a new token and uses it for that request without prompting the user.
2. **Given** a valid token that is outside the refresh window, **When** a request is initiated, **Then** the system reuses the existing token and sends the request without delay.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the service cannot generate a new token before the request deadline?
- How does the system handle multiple simultaneous requests that each see the token nearing expiry?
- What should occur if the authority rejects the newly generated token?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST review each outgoing request to confirm the associated authentication token will remain valid during request processing.
- **FR-002**: System MUST refresh tokens proactively when remaining validity is at or below the lesser of 120 seconds or 20% of the token's original TTL.
- **FR-003**: System MUST automatically generate a replacement token whenever the current token falls within the refresh window.
- **FR-004**: System MUST route the newly generated token to all pending and subsequent requests to avoid reuse of nearly expired credentials.
- **FR-005**: System MUST emit structured tracing events for refresh attempts and escalate to operators when three consecutive refresh failures occur without recovery.
- **FR-006**: System MUST retain refresh attempt telemetry in external logs for at least 90 days to satisfy audit requests.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Authentication Token Lifecycle**: Represents the state of a token from issuance through validation, refresh, and expiration, including timestamps and responsible owning service.
- **Refresh Policy**: Captures the business rules defining refresh window, retry limits, and escalation paths governing automatic renewal behavior.
