# Feature Specification: Fix JWT Generation

**Feature Branch**: `[006-fix-jwt-generation]`  
**Created**: 2025-09-17  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "fix jwt generation by updating the specs from task 002"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions  
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a platform operations engineer relying on the Task 002 JWT flow, I need the specification corrected so auto-generated tokens are reliable across Snowflake environments without manual claim tweaking.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given a service configured with the documented Snowflake account locator, automation user, and unencrypted PKCS#8 private key, When it requests a JWT after applying this specification, Then Snowflake control-plane and streaming ingestion endpoints accept the token without additional adjustments.
2. Given a configuration that misses a required claim value or uses an unsupported key format, When the service attempts to mint a JWT, Then it receives an actionable message describing the exact remediation and no invalid token is issued.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a passphrase-protected private key is supplied? The system must stop issuance, explain the unsupported format, and direct the operator to provide an unencrypted PKCS#8 key.
- How does the system handle clock drift greater than the allowed tolerance? The system must enforce a 120-second leeway, refuse tokens outside that window, and guide operators to resynchronize time sources.
- How does the system support multi-tenant principals? The system must require users to declare whether the subject represents a Snowflake user or role and document how to obtain dedicated tokens for each tenant.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST generate JWTs that satisfy Snowflake acceptance checks for both control-plane APIs and Snowpipe Streaming ingestion without manual claim overrides.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST document and enforce the mapping of account locator, automation user, and (optional) role identifiers to the appropriate Snowflake JWT claims before a token is issued.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST restrict signing to RS256 and fail fast with guidance if operators attempt to configure any other algorithm.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST validate that supplied private keys are unencrypted PKCS#8 material and provide explicit remediation steps when formats or passphrases are unsupported.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST enforce an expiration window between 60 and 600 seconds and block issuance when requested values fall outside that range or drift beyond the allowed tolerance.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **JWT Token**: Represents the signed assertion delivered to Snowflake, containing issuer, subject, audience, issued-at, and expiration claims that adhere to the documented mapping.
- **Principal Configuration**: Captures the Snowflake account locator, automation user or role identifier, target endpoint type (control-plane vs streaming), and validity duration used to request a token.
