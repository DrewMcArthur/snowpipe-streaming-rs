# Feature Specification: Fix JWT Generation

**Feature Branch**: `[006-fix-jwt-generation]`  
**Created**: 2025-09-17  
**Status**: Ready for PR  
**Input**: User description: "fix jwt generation by updating the specs from task 002"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions  
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer integrating this library, I need the client to generate the Snowflake keypair JWT locally from a provided private key so that authentication works reliably without calling a non-existent `/oauth2/token` endpoint, and without changing any downstream behavior that already worked.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given account/user identifiers and a valid private key (path or inline), When constructing the client, Then a JWT is generated locally and used for discovery and scoped-token flows without any call to `/oauth2/token`.
2. Given missing or invalid key material, When attempting JWT generation, Then the library returns a clear, actionable error without panicking.

### Edge Cases
- Encrypted PEM keys: Supported when a passphrase is provided. If an encrypted key is supplied without a passphrase, return an actionable error.
- Clock drift and proactive/retroactive refresh: Out of scope for this change. JWT default validity is one hour; refresh behavior may be addressed in a future feature.
- Header scheme and downstream flows: No changes. Existing Bearer + `KEYPAIR_JWT` control-plane behavior and ingest scoped-token flow remain as-is.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST generate a keypair JWT locally from provided account/user and private key inputs; it MUST NOT call `/oauth2/token`.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST accept private key material via path or inline string; it MUST support encrypted PKCS#8 keys when a passphrase is provided and MUST error when missing.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST preserve existing post-JWT behavior (header scheme, discovery, scoped token) with no changes required for callers.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST surface actionable errors for invalid keys or signing failures and avoid panics.
- **FR-005**: The system SHOULD allow configuring expiration duration (default one hour); token refresh strategies are out of scope for this feature.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Private Key Material**: PEM/DER, possibly encrypted PKCS#8 with optional passphrase.
- **JWT Claims**: issuer, subject, audience, issued-at, expiration, and unique ID.
