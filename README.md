# Snowpipe Streaming Rust SDK

This library is meant to replicate the python api interface, to allow users to stream data to snowflake via the snowpipe streaming API.  This is a naive implementation, since the Python and Java SDKs are not open source, so I'm guessing based off the REST guide and the external visibility of the Python SDK.
